Great idea! Here's a complete, well-organized Markdown file you can keep in your repo (or anywhere else) to **refer back to every time you face this file case rename issue on Git in Windows**.

# ⚙️ Fixing Case-Sensitive Filename Renames in Git on Windows

This guide explains how to **fix file renaming issues** where only the case of the filename changes (like `header.jsx` → `Header.jsx`) — a common problem on **case-insensitive file systems** like Windows.

---

## 🧠 Problem Overview

- You rename a file (`header.jsx` → `Header.jsx`)
- `git status` shows "nothing to commit"
- You push, but nothing updates on GitHub or Netlify
- Netlify or build tools throw:  
  `Module not found: Can't resolve './Header.jsx'`

---

## ✅ Root Cause

Windows does **not treat `Header.jsx` and `header.jsx` as different files**, but Git (on Linux/macOS servers) **does**.  
So Git doesn’t detect the rename unless you explicitly force it.

---

## 🛠️ Full Fix Steps

### 1. **Enable Case Sensitivity in Git**

```bash
git config core.ignorecase false
````

If you're working across multiple machines, run this globally too:

```bash
git config --global core.ignorecase false
```

---

### 2. **Force Rename via Temporary Name**

If Git doesn't detect the case change:

```bash
# Rename to a temp name
rename Header.jsx temp.jsx

# Then rename back to proper case
rename temp.jsx Header.jsx
```

Or via Git directly:

```bash
git mv Header.jsx temp.jsx
git mv temp.jsx Header.jsx
```

---

### 3. **Stage and Commit the Rename**

```bash
git add src/components/Header.jsx
git commit -m "Fix: Rename header.jsx to Header.jsx (case-sensitive)"
git push
```

If multiple files:

```bash
git add src/components/*.jsx
git commit -m "Fix: Track renamed component files"
git push
```

---

### 4. **Optional: Configure Line Endings**

To avoid repeated `LF will be replaced by CRLF` warnings on Windows:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

---

## 🔁 Recap Checklist

✅ `core.ignorecase = false`
✅ Used `rename` or `git mv`
✅ `git add` the **new filename**
✅ `git commit` and `git push`

## 📌 Common Errors

| Error Message                                    | Meaning                      | Fix                           |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `nothing to commit, working tree clean`          | Git ignored your rename      | Use `rename` or `git mv`      |
| `Module not found: Can't resolve './Header.jsx'` | Wrong casing pushed          | Fix local rename + push again |
| `fatal: pathspec ... did not match any files`    | Wrong path used in `git add` | Use relative path from root   |

---

## 🧩 Pro Tip

Use this command to **see ignored case problems**:

```bash
git ls-files -i --exclude-standard
```
